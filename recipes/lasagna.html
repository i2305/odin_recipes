            <li>1/2 cup water </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided ot to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black peper</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4 pound mozarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook sausage, onion, ground beef and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat, until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 tablespoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds and peper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley and 1/2 tablespoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in a bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure that foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
